# PurchasePrediction

Note: We have used different transformations for implementing different models, that is why the repository contains multiple .csv files. Below are the five key points describing the scripts and the .csv files to be used to execute the five models in R/RStudio:

(1) For Baseline Model : Use "baseline.R" and when prompted for a dataset select the file "train.csv".

(2) For SVM Model : Use "baseline.R" and when prompted for a dataset select the file "train.csv". 

(3) For XGBoosting Model : Use "baseline.R" and when prompted for a dataset select the file "train.csv". 

(4) For KNN Model : Use "baseline.R" and when prompted for a dataset select the file "train.csv". 

(5) For Random Forest Model : Use "baseline.R" and when prompted for a dataset select the file "train.csv".
